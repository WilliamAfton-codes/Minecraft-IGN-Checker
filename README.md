# Minecraft-IGN-Checker
Randomly generates 3-digit IGNs (with letters, numbers and underscores) and checks if they are available as a Minecraft: Java Edition username (NOT MICROSOFT PROFILE)
# Usage
Download `main.py` from the releases and run it. Input how many IGNs to generate and the program will do the rest!

To change the length of the generated IGN, open `main.py` with a note editor (e.g. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org)) and go to line 7. Change the 'N = 3' variable to 'N = x' where x is your desired IGN length. Hit save and run the program
# Requirements
Python 3.10 (I havent tested previous versions)

An internet connection (To use Mojang's API to check each IGN)
