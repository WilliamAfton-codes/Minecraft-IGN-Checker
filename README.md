# Minecraft-IGN-Checker
Randomly generates 3-digit IGNs (with letters, numbers and underscores) and checks if they are available as a Minecraft: Java Edition username (NOT MICROSOFT PROFILE)
# Usage
Run minecraft-ign-checker.py and input how many IGNs to generate and test.

To change the length of the generated IGN, open minecraft-ign-checker.py with a note editor (e.g. Notepad++) and go to line 7. Change the 'N = 3' variable to 'N = x' where x is your desired IGN length. Hit save and run the program
# Requirements
Python 3.10 (I havent tested previous versions)

An internet connection (To use Mojang's API to check each IGN)
